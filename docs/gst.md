# GST

**Goods and Services Tax**, is an indirect tax imposed on the supply of `goods` and `services`. It is a multi-stage, destination-oriented tax imposed on every value addition, replacing multiple indirect taxes, including VAT, excise duty, service taxes, etc.

* [IGST; Integrated Goods and Services Tax](https://groww.in/p/tax/igst-integrated-goods-and-services-tax)

### What are the 4 types of GST?
There are Four GST types namely
* [Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)](#integrated-goods-and-services-tax-igst)
* [State Goods and Services Tax (SGST)](#state-goods-and-services-tax-sgst)
* [Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST)](#central-goods-and-services-tax-cgst)
* [Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST)](#union-territory-goods-and-services-tax-utgst)

### Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)
The GST category applies to taxes levied on interstate purchases or supplies of taxable services and goods and imports of services and goods. The Central Government collects IGST and it is `subsequently distributed` among all the respective `states`.

### State Goods and Services Tax (SGST)
Under GST, an equivalent amount of SGST is a tax levied on `intrastate` supplies of both goods and services by the particular state government where the product sold is consumed.

### Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST)
It subsumes all the taxes that were earlier applicable as `central indirect` taxes. They are levied by the central government for the intrastate movement of goods and services.

### Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST)
Similar to how SGST is levied by the state governments on the intra-state supply of goods and services, UTGST is levied by the handful of `Union Territory governments`.

### How GST Calculated?
For example,
if a product or service costs **Rs.100** and the **GST** levied on that is **18%**, the GST amount will be `100 x 18% = Rs.18`. The net amount you’d have to pay would be Rs. `118`.
```
GST Amount = Cost of the Product * (GST Percentage / 100)
```
```
Net Pay = Cost of the Product + GST Amount
```

### SGST Vs CGST Vs IGST

The GST to be levied by the Centre on intra state supply of goods and / or services is `Central GST (CGST)` and that by the States is `State GST (SGST)`. On supply of goods and services outside the state, `Integrated GST (IGST)` will be collected by Centre. IGST also applies on `imports` as well.

### GST rates in India

GST rates in India for various goods and services are divided into four slabs:
* 5% GST
* 12% GST
* 18% GST
* 28% GST

Since the inception of the Goods and Services Tax, the GST Council has revised the GST rates for various products several times (GST).

### How IGST Calculated?

[Document](https://groww.in/p/tax/igst-integrated-goods-and-services-tax)

```
IGST = CGST + SGST
```
But this is just a numerical game. It does not mean that IGST is more expensive.

Let’s take the example of cashew nuts. 

**Interstate**: Cashew nuts attract an `IGST of 5%` in case of `interstate transfer`. So if cashew nuts are being sold from Delhi to Agra, `traders in Agra` will pay the IGST, traders in Delhi will collect it and they pay it to the government

**Intrastate**: In case of transfer within the same state, it will attract a CGST of 2.5% that goes to the `central government` and SGST of 2.5% that goes to the `Central government`. In total, the tax incidence is 5%.

So, CGST and SGST are two halves of the IGST. This goes the same for all the products.
